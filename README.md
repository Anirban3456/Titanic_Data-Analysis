# Titanic Data Analysis

## Description

This paper explores a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) study using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The main objective is to decipher the complex patterns pertaining to the allocation of surviving among the occupants of the tragic Titanic. In order to provide insight on the dynamics that affected survival rates, the analysis examines a number of variables, including age, sex, class, and other pertinent aspects.

### Goals
- The Gender vs Survived Ratio
- Fare Category with the most Survivability
- The category of People who had the best and worst possibility to survive

### The Gender vs Survived Ratio

This Shows that more Females survived than Males. An estimate of 231 Females survived while only 109 males survived.

### Fare Category with the most Survivability

This shows that Passenger who paid more than 10,000$ had much more chances of surviving than people who paid less than 10,000$

This shows that Women at Pclass(1) had the best chance of surviving. Men at Pclass(3) had the least chance of surviving while Women at Pclass(3) had a 50% chance of surviving.
